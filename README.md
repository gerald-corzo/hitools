# Example Package

This package contains

Functions to evaluate error in space and time

Basic spatiotemporal analysis of errors and patters

1. Implementation of time series errors
2. Implementation of spatial patterns obtains from lineal thresholds
3. Implementation of spatial patterns obtains from non-linear thresholds

This package is under development and slowly the documentation and reference to publications will be addedd

Target are:

Spatiotemporal analysis of extreme events
Tracking of spatial patterns
Categorization of spatial forms and its comparison
Tracking Airmasses to find contributions of water in a basin per month
Forecasting drought
Forecasting floods
Analysisng syncronicity


Modelling with convolutional networks
